This is an updated version of the M_P_Val program described in Garza and Williamson (2001).

It has been compiled as a Universal binary for Apple OS X by
Eric Anderson.  It has also been bundled up as a Mac application bundle that will run with a Java GUI frontend using GuiLiner (http://guiliner.sourceforge.net/).

It should run with Apple OS 10.4 and 10.5. It does not run with 10.3, but machines running that version generally support Apple Classic mode, with which one can run the original M_P_Val. 

This program will not behave well when placed in a file location that
has spaces in its full path.  Therefore you are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED
to copy the entire MRatio folder to your Desktop directory, and 
also put any data files you wish to analyze in that directory.

Once the folder is in its proper location, you run M_P_Val by double clicking the program's icon.  You will get a window that has 
all the program options in a tree to the left (you may want to
hit "Expand All" to see all the options).  The ones in red are 
required.  Click on the Input File option and the right pane will let you Select your data file.  Choose your file, then click OK.  When you are done setting all the options. Then click Run Program in the top tool bar. The results will appear in the lower console window. You can copy and save them to a text editor.

The method description can be accessed by clicking on the Information icon above the right pane.

This folder comes with an example data set for M_P_Val.
